Tone numbers:
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, just like in jyutping.

Obvious problems:
- в(v) vs у(u): Ukrainian в may be more like w as a "final", so while Cantonese only has w/u (and they are the same), in Ukrainian it makes more sense to write в as an ending u.
- г vs ґ: ґ is still a rare letter but Cantonese also has both h and g. I am not sure if -ng should still be written нґ, when "Hong Kong" is written Гонконг. In fact, ґ doesn't appear in most country/region names esp. if they are fairly old names. But it is safe to say ґ should be the initial g in Cantonese. х is a possible candidate for h in Cantonese, but Cantonese has no such sound, and I don't see the need of х.
- Cantonese yu is a single vowel and practically Cantonese has more vowels than Ukrainian. Yu is also difficult to transliterate.
- я, є, ї may be used for ja, je, ji, but ю is too different from Cantonese yu to be usable.
- However, if I consider everything together, basically you can have
1. use ґ only in an initial letter g in jyutping
2. use в only in initials (w/gw/kw) and у elsewhere (as vowel)
