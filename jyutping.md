## How to pronounce Cantonese in my opinion
### Consonants
- If we ignore tones for now, generally speaking, most sounds in Cantonese are common and are found in other languages. There are very few voiced consonants in Cantonese despite the spelling. I see the most potential issues are in finals where there are the famous -p, -t, -k syllable endings, as well as the not-very-usual yu sound. I think Cantonese phonology is one of the easiest systems and many other languages have harder sounds.
- Plosives: none of them is voiced. b is like French p and unaspirated. p is like b but aspirated. The same is true of d/t and g/k.
- Nasals: there are m, n and ng. Ng (like ng in English *sing*) also starts a syllable and can be a syllable itself, so it may sound unusual.
- Fricatives: the simple f and h.
- Sibilants and affricates: we have s but no z (like English *z*). Letter z is like ц, and c is aspirated z, so it sounds close to ч.
- Liquids: only l. Contrary to popular beliefs, Cantonese is possibly a "major" East Asian language that really has no r-sound. Those who know the r-sound mostly know the English one.
- j and w: j is like German j in *jeder* or English y in *year*. w is English w or u.

### Vowels
- Cantonese has... a, e, i, o, u, but also oe (like French oe in *soeur* or German ö in *Löffel*) and yu (like French u in *sur* or German ü in *Bücher*).
- eo is similar to oe but they appear in different syllables, so people don't usually confuse them.
- In modern Cantonese varieties I know of, vowel length is irrelevant. People lengthen vowels only for emphasis/humour.
- There is another vowel called aa because it is more open and longer than a. Since they are distributed in different syllables, people don't usually confuse them.
- Whenever you see -p, -t, -k at the end of a syllable, it is unaspirated. In English, if you say *but*, *beep* and *buck* casually, you don't pronounce t/p/k so much.

## Obvious problems:
- в(v): Ukrainian в may be more like w as a "final", so while Cantonese only has w/u (and they are the same), in Ukrainian it makes more sense to write в as an ending u.
- г vs ґ: ґ is still a rare letter but Cantonese also has both h and g (voiceless). I am not sure if -ng should still be written нґ, when "Hong Kong" is written Гонконг. In fact, ґ doesn't appear in most country/region names esp. if they are fairly old names. But it is safe to say ґ should be the initial g in Cantonese.
- х is a possible candidate for h in Cantonese, but Cantonese has no such sound, and I don't see the need of х.
- Cantonese yu is a single vowel and practically Cantonese has more vowels than Ukrainian. Yu is also difficult to transliterate.
- я, є, ї may be used for jaa, je, ji, but ю is too different from Cantonese yu.
- However, if I consider everything together, basically you can have
1. use ґ only in an initial letter g in jyutping
2. use в only in initials (w/gw/kw) and у elsewhere as the same as w/u

## Summary
- Basically most sounds are predictable/easy/found in other languages. It should have been an easy language if we only talk about speaking... or speaking without tones.
- Words/tone-related minimal pairs/characters are out of the scope of discussion, but I can assure learners that homophones (same syllable, even same tone) are not so bad in Cantonese. As in many other languages, puns and naming culture often depend on sounds instead of characters.
